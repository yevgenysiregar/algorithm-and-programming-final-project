Here's my Algorithm and Programming final project, I'm creating a simple rock, paper, scissor game with python.

Brief Description:

This game at first require the player to enter their name. After that, the main menu will appear and 4 options will be displayed.
First, the fight menu, to play the rock, paper, scissor against computer.
Second, the history menu, to see the history of previous games played.
Third, the info menu, to see the HP of the player.
Last, The exit menu, to exit the game.

At first, the player will be given 100 HP. when the player won the round or got a tie on the round, the player HP won't be reduced or added.
The other way around, if the player loses the round, the player HP will be reduced 10 points per lost round.

Essential Algorithm:

 1. Looping: this program uses for loop and while loop
 2. Control Flow: this program uses nested if else statement
 3. Dictionary: this program uses dictionary to keep history
 4. Class: This program uses class to make it easier to implement data
 5. Function/method: this program uses function/method to make it easier to write a code that are reusable

Lesson Learned:

In this final project, I learned to make a class and method and its implementation inside a flow of a game.
Beside that, I learned to use dictionary to keep a data that has the same key.
